Mike Gioia's GitHub Page
Mike Gioia needed a GitHub Page. Github needed a Mike Gioia. It seemed like a natural pairing and the Duchess of Windsor was pleased by the idea.
"A place to list and sort miscellany about himself?" She tittered at the image. "Yes, that will be most necessary. Most necessary indeed."
Details of the man's doings were spread across the web, available to any who cared to look. The duchess preferred central planning.
So here be the page with all his doings. Hosted, as deemed fitting by the Duchess, on Github Pages.
